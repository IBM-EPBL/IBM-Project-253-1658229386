            &emsp; Liver diseases avert the normal function of the liver. Mainly due to the large amount of alcohol
            consumption
            liver disease arises. Early prediction of liver disease using classification algorithms is an
            efficacious
            task that can help the doctors to diagnose the disease within a short duration of time. Discovering the
            existence of liver disease at an early stage is a complex task for the doctors. The main objective of
            this
            project is to analyze the parameters of various classification algorithms and compare their predictive
            accuracies so as to find out the best classifier for determining the liver disease.
            <br><br>
            &emsp; This Project examines data from liver patients concentrating on relationships between a key list of
            liver
            enzymes, proteins, age and gender using them to try and predict the likeliness of liver disease. Here we
            are
            building a model by applying various machine learning algorithms find the best accurate model. And
            integrate
            to flask based web application. User can predict the disease by entering parameters in the web
            application.
